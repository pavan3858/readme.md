## AIM
In this assignment we will be using python to find the fourier series cofficient of the two functions e(x) and cos(cos(x)) using the known formulae. After that we will try to find out the best possible cofficients using least square method and then we will compare both the cofficients and plot their graphs
### INTRODUCTION
we begin by plotting the two graphs in the interval -2pi to 4pi.
Plot e(x) in semilogy because it increases rapidly.
After this we will find the fourier series cofficients using the least square method and compare them
